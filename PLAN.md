# Plan for peopleBase

The splash screen has three buttons -- one that will do a `git pull` (and therefore updating), one that will launch the customer database, and one that will launch the scheduler.

Sort of like a spreadsheet for the schedule: One button per increment, it will ask you to fill in the data on click, or you can press the New Entry button.

Schedule: Will have a JSON save file that contains one list per employee: one entry of list per 5 minutes.

Customer database will have a folder with customer data. A JSON Index will be used to keep track of things.
